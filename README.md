# Alien Text
A fun little project to visualise [cistercian numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercian_numerals).
It also  works with text (`{ a:1, b:2 ... }`).

Use spaces to force a new symbol to be created, numbers will otherwise be grouped into chunks of 4 as each symbol can hold 4, single digit numbers. letters will always be grouped into chunks of 2. The bottom being used for the first letter & the top being used for the second.

I Created this using p5js. I Might improve this in the future & give it a cooler interface. especially if I can come up with some uses for the symbols it creates.
